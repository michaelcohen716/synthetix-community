Thanks to the productive SNX professor, @nocturnalsheet, you can now tip SNX to other community members in the Synthetix Discord. This post explains how to use it. 

## How to get started

To tip someone, you'll need someone to tip you first or you'll need to deposit some SNX. 

To deposit, you'll need to type `$deposit SNX` somewhere in the Synthetix Discord. You'll then receive a DM from the tip bot (called "tip.cc"). Its DM will include an ERC20 wallet address, which you can send SNX to however you usually transfer ERC20 tokens. Once you receive a confirmation message there, you'll be able to start tipping!

## How to tip someone

Tipping someone is easy. Simply type anywhere in the Discord server `$tip @user amount SNX`. 

For example, if you wanted to tip @nocturnalsheet 20 SNX, you would type `$tip @nocturnalsheet 20 SNX`. You may need to confirm with a "yes" command if it asks you (for larger amounts). It's as simple as that! 

## Withdrawing your SNX

To withdraw your SNX, simply DM the tip bot `$withdraw SNX` and follow the steps provided in the DM.
