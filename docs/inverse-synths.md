The team has a good explanation <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/inverse-synths-are-back/#how-inverse-synths-work-" class="link" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.synthetix.io/tokens/#inverse-isynths" class="link" target="_blank">here</a> of how inverse synths work. Synths trade in a range with an upper and lower limit and, if limits are breached by the real-world asset, the synth is disabled and the positions are liquidated. At some point after, the team will deploy a new version of the inverse synth with new upper and lower bounds.
