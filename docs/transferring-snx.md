There are some limitations to transferring the SNX tokens in your wallet. You can't transfer:
- staked tokens: the SNX that collateralize your debt up to 750%
- escrowed tokens: SNX rewards remain locked under escrow for a year after distribution

## Burning sUSD

To unlock staked tokens, press `Burn` on <a href="https://beta.mintr.synthetix.io/" class="link" target="_blank">Mintr</a>. Press `View transferable SNX`. Here you'll be able to gauge how much SNX you can unlock for burning a given amount of sUSD. Crucially, you'll need to burn enough sUSD to unlock *at least* the number of escrowed rewards tokens you have, before you'll be able to access transferable SNX.
